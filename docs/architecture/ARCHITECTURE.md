## Shape

web/                    Svelte 5 + Vite frontend
cmd/api/                Go process entry point
internal/httpapi/       HTTP/API and static-web boundary
internal/postgresstore/ PostgreSQL adapter behind a small interface
db/migrations/          project-owned schema migrations
scripts/                setup, migration and canonical verification
.hexa/project           Hexa.Build Dev + Runtime lifecycle adapter
~~~

## Invariants

- Browser code talks to the application through /api; it never receives database credentials.
- PostgreSQL is an external persistent dependency. Runtime release roots remain immutable.
- Domain/application behavior should move into explicit internal packages as the product grows; do not turn HTTP handlers or database rows into the domain model by default.
- Canonical verification is ./scripts/verify.sh; CI and Hexa.Build call it rather than duplicating test policy.
- /healthz remains cheap and reports database configuration/readiness separately.
- Svelte code uses Svelte 5 conventions. New event handlers use event properties such as onclick/onsubmit, not legacy on: directives.
- Generated code has no runtime dependency on Hexa.Build.
